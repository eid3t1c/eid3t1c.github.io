<h2>Small Description</h2>

</div>

<p style="text-align:justify">
I'm a student who stumbled upon cybersecurity two years ago through a university course, and I’ve been hooked ever since. In February 2023 i started my journey in <span style="color:#e60000">cryptography</span>, diving into it for several months until it felt a bit boring. That's when I shifted to <span style="color:#0061b2">forensics</span> and <span style="color:#b96a05">reverse engineering</span>—two fields that both fascinating and very demanding.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
After a year or so, CTFs began to feel more like a chore than a learning adventure. I decided it was time to take a break, focus on myself and my personal interests (touching grass), while staying connected to cybersecurity from a distance.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Fast-forward a few months: motivated once again, I’ve started to explore <span style="color:#119729">mobile security</span>, particularly .apk security
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">
Currently, I am more focused in learning Active Directory and red teaming techniques. With this blog i am just looking to explore intresting topics and acquire technical skills and perhaps showcase some :).
